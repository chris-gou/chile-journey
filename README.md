# React Travel Journal

This is a small travel journal that I created for my semester abroad in Chile using `ReactJS`. I created this by following some tutorials on the topic. It includes most of the places I visited during my 6 months in the country and some information I liked about those places. I have also included an image for each place (I took these images on my own).
