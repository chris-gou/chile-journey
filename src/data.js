      description: `Santiago was my home for 6 months and it felt like that since the first time I got there, in plain summer of 30°C (February).
        I had the chance to go hiking, visit parks, museums, wineries, and more. The views are incredible, everyday I could see the Andes peaking at me.
        Fun fact: the tallest skyscraper in LATAM is located in Santiago (and I got to see the view from floor 64).

      description: `Chiloe is actually an archipelago of islands located in the southern part of the country. 
      The easiest way to get there is by flying to Puerto Montt and from there getting the ferry to Castro. During a small 4-day trip,
      I was lucky enough to see some of the islands (and also Puerto Montt) and I was impressed by the nature, everything was so green. 
      A big highlight of the trip: Seeing penguins, sea lions, and dolphins, all on the same day. Also hiking a volcano!`,

      The region of Magallanes is a gift to nature and as soon as you step there, you feel at peace. Even though we went in the end of spring,
      I was already feeling the cold, which is why most people choose to visit in the summer. Highlight of the trip: seeing a whale's spout.`,

      The city is built on hills, so a leg workout is pretty intense when walking throughout the city. Highlight of the trip: Seeing tsunami evacuation sings everywhere.`,

      description: `Going north, on an almost 8 hour bus trip from the city, we reached the Elqui valley. 
      As soon as we stepped out from the bus, we could feel the difference in the air quality, everything was so clear there.
      Almost no cars or houses, we were literally in the middle of nowhere. The elqui region is famous for the production of Pisco,
      made from distilled grapes (there's a dispute between Peru and Chile for the origin of Pisco). 
      Highlight of the trip: Seeing the moon and the stars through a telescope.`,

      description: `The northest part I reached was the desert of San Pedro de Atacama (actually the driest non-polar desert in the world).
      Here, it is possible to drive straight for 2 hours, change 3 landscapes, and still have 1 hour to go for your destination.
      I saw among others dunes, salt lakes, volcanoes, mountaines, lots of animals, and geysers. Highlight of the trip: 
      Probably gettin a flat tire (literally) in the middle of nowhere (thankfully a car drove by 2 minutes after and they changed our tire).`,
