            In February of 2023 I boarded a 14 hour flight from Paris, France, to
            Santiago, Chile, where I would spend the next 5 months as a part of my
            university semester abroad. I had the chance to study for a semester
            at Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile, one of the country's and
            the&nbsp;

            &nbsp; During that time I also had the opportunity to get to know my
            new home, Santiago, and to travel throughout the country (and a bit
            outside). A big part of my unforgettable experience is due to the
            people I met there, however here I chose to focus on the places that I
            saw and that impressed me along the way (see the map attached).{" "}

            Before getting to Chile, I honestly was not aware of the many wonders
            that this country has and I am very thankful to have seen some of
            them. I certainly hope to go back and get to know it more. Here are
            some of the impressionable places that I fell in love with and at
            which I made many memories. In the map below I highlighted the places
            that stuck along the way.
